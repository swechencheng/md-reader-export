Extension that exports the md-reader rendered page to html

## Usage

This extension depends on another extension [`md-reader`](https://github.com/md-reader/md-reader) on [chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-reader/medapdbncneneejhbgcjceippjlfkmkg).

This gives you a green `Export HTML` button on bottom-right of the raw Markdown page which is rendered by [`md-reader`](https://github.com/md-reader/md-reader) in your browser.
It gives you the functionality to export the rendered page to a HTML file which contains the [md-reader theme](https://github.com/md-reader/theme).

Though, due to my knowledge limitation, this extension does not include the side panel which [`md-reader`](https://github.com/md-reader/md-reader) renders.
However, it still gives you a ToC which I believe is good enough.

## Background

It comes from the need of a [WIP feature](https://github.com/orgs/md-reader/discussions/50).

I heavily want to export a document which I write in Markdown including [`Mermaid` diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/) for others which don't use Markdown. But export using [VSCode extension Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) does not give a as pretty styling as [`md-reader`](https://github.com/md-reader/md-reader) does.

So I explored a bit, and found this [WIP feature](https://github.com/orgs/md-reader/discussions/50), and decided to do a quick hack myself.

## Disclaimer

The whole JS is generated by AI `Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Reasoning` since I am **not** a frontend developer.

I tried a bunch of different AI reasoning models, e.g. DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3-mini-high, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Reasoning, etc.

But only `Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Reasoning` gives me the best results.
